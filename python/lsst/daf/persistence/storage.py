        """Register derived classes for lookup by URI scheme.

        A scheme is a name that describes the form a resource at the beginning of a URI
        e.g. 'http' indicates HTML and related code, such as is found in http://www.lsst.org

        The only currently supported schemes are:
        * 'file' where the portion of the URI after the // indicates an absolute locaiton on disk.
          for example: file:/my_repository_folder/
        * '' (no scheme) where the entire string is a relative path on the local system
          for example "my_repository_folder" will indicate a folder in the current working directory with the
          same name.

        See documentation for the urlparse python library for more information.
